### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### ðŸŒ± Some stuff I did in the past which *may* be of interest to you

Most of them will serve the purpose of reference / documentation to me, but maybe you will find something useful alongside :)

##### Rust

* [wasm-tetris](https://github.com/liona24/wasm-tetris) - A simple Tetris clone built for WebAssembly
* [poppy](https://github.com/liona24/poppy) - A simple Texas Hold'em poker library in Rust. Why you ask? Because why not.
* [webgl-matrix](https://github.com/liona24/webgl-matrix) - A very lightweight matrix library which was built to ease the use of the WebGL API from WebAssembly code directly
* [path-edit](https://github.com/liona24/path-edit) - Pretty much the results of an experiment to create a path editor which supports O(1) update operations while at the same time following a flat layout of the vertex storage (as required by f. e. OpenGL)

##### Python

* [snippets](https://github.com/liona24/snipppets) - A collection of code snippets / very small projects. For documentation and the curious :)
* [rezept-o-mat](https://github.com/liona24/rezept-o-mat) - A wep app which will fetch a random recipe from a specified API so you can go straight to cooking instead of spending *hours* on deciding which recipe to choose.
* [utility-scripts](https://github.com/liona24/utility-scripts) - Some simple command line tools I put together which are either in daily use or helpful from time to time.

##### CTF related stuff

* [bop](https://github.com/liona24/bop) - Educational collection of some (historical) cryptographic attack vectors which are (may be) useful if you are a) learning or b) solving simple *crypto-challenges*.
* [angr-examples](https://github.com/liona24/angr-examples) - Personal collection of simple [angr](https://github.com/angr/angr) usage examples
* [Write-Ups](https://github.com/liona24/ctf-writeups) - All the write-ups I once wrote

##### Other projects of medium importance

* [evoku](https://github.com/liona24/evoku) - An approach at solving sudokus using evolutionary algorithms.
* [SmartTools](https://github.com/liona24/SmartTools) - A collection of computer vision algorithms in C#. They were once implemented for educational purposes. There actually is a lot of interesting stuff in there, though I am afraid the documentation is not optimal.
* [PixelRaetsel](https://github.com/liona24/PixelRaetsel) - In the german magazine [PM](https://www.pm-wissen.com/) occasionally puzzles appeared which require you to fill single pixels in a grid according to some rules. Eventually you would recover an image. This is a software tool which is able to generate these puzzles based on an input image.
* [creep-rolling](https://github.com/liona24/creep-rolling) - Originally planned to be a small walking robot which could transform itself into a sphere this project is awaiting to be 3d-printed.
